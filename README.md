How do I approach designing software?
  One design skill I learned was breaking the project down into smaller parts. Each week in the course, I worked on a different part of the project, from the lighting, the shapes, colors and textures. After working on them little by little, the last thing I had to do was put them all together and make sure it runs smoothly. I kinda followed the SDLC when completing my project. I would code some of it then test it, and I would repeat the process over and over again until I got it right. This could help me in the future because it taught me how to break a hard and difficult project into easier sections. 

  How do I approach developing programs?
    One big strategy I used was breaking the project down into smaller parts.Before this course, I liked to do coding all at once, however in this course it was difficult to do. Knowing this will help me in the future because it taught me that breaking it into smaller parts can help save time and help identify any errors in the project. 

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
      One way computer science can help me reach my goal is that this course taught me a lot of new skills. By learning OpenGL and skills like that, it can help open up a new career for me in graphic design. Having skills like OpenGL is great because in a competive job market, the more skills you have and the more you know will help you get the career you want.
